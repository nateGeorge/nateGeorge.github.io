### Air quality monitor

I've made a beta version of my air quality monitor.  I'm still crafting a professional case for it, so I won't post any pictures until that's finished.  

The device posts data to the internet, and you can use it to turn on or off smart outlets with fans or air purifiers connected.  Text alerts can be set up for using the device as a smoke alarm (for fire or burning food), and a map of the data from the device can be viewed on the aircasting website.  <a href="mailto:nathancgeorge@gmail.com?Subject=Order particle%20sensor%20beta%20unit%20" target="_top">Email me to order a beta test unit.
