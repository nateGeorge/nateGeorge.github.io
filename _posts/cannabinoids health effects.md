Cannabinoids (CBD and THC in particular) show potential and much evidence of anti-cancer properties[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/68/2/339.short], by increasing the apoptosis[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16250836/, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16728591/] (programmed cell death, i.e. cell suicide).  There is evidence for CBD inhibiting lung cancer[http://www.fasebj.org/content/26/4/1535.short, http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/12/1/69.short], colon cancer[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00109-011-0856-x], and breast cancer[http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/10/7/1161.short].  There are likely other types of cancer out there that CBD inhibits, but I haven't exhaustively researched it yet.

Cannabinoids also seem to treat chronic pain (especially nerve-related disorders) well, but not acute pain[http://journals.lww.com/co-anesthesiology/Abstract/2007/10000/Reassessment_of_the_role_of_cannabinoids_in_the.11.aspx, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430692/].  In fact, cannabinoids at high doses can make acute pain worse.  However, for things like arthritis[http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/1/50.short], multiple-sclerosis[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429990601257X, http://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918(07)00294-9/abstract], and chronic headaches[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.12570/full, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J175v01n02_04], cannabinoids can be a good solution.

CBD and THC also have neuroprotective antioxidant properties[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20965/], meaning they will allow you to remain more intelligent, younger looking, and better feeling, for a long time.

I have one big beef with the cannabinoid craze--so many people like to smoke it, and smoking is really bad for you!  You're intentionally inhaling pollution, damaging your body and brain!  Although cannabinoids can be anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant, smoke is incredibly carcinogenic and oxidizing.  If you actually want to get health benefits from cannabinoids, you need to ingest it with other methods, the best being eating and/or drinking it.  Tinctures, foods, and other forms of cannabinoid food and drink are easy to make and delicious, and that is the way you can reap all the health benefits of carcinogenic.  My guess is that smoking it ends up in a wash--no health benefit, and possibly even a health detraction.  I find it extremely funny that people like to say they're going to 'smoke their medicine'--smoking anything is inhaling toxins, and the opposite of medicine!  Silly monkeys.
