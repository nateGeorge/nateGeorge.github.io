## A few investment opportunities

A few months ago I was at the [Wall Street Journal Eco:nomics conference](http://economics.wsj.com/){:target="_blank"} in Santa Barbara.  It's a conference geared towards energy, economics, and the environment.  Some of the speakers were investment bankers and venture capitalists, as well as CEOs of many prominent companies like Ford, SunRun, Opower, Duke Energy, and a few politicians were thrown in for good measure.  I did walk away with a few nuggets of investment advice from these folks.

## Oil is down, and midstream companies are undervalued

[Douglas Kimmelman that made the point](http://www.wsj.com/articles/two-bankers-discuss-their-energy-bets-1460502919){:target="_blank"} that low oil prices have dragged the entire oil and gas sector downward.  However, as he pointed out, midstream companies (those who make their money by transporting, storing, and wholesale marketing) make their money by fees, and should not be as effected by low oil prices.  Therefore, he was saying midstream companies are a good buy now.  Do these guys have a conflict of interest because they're invested in midstream companies?  I don't know.  Last year was a huge sell-off for midstream companies and the whole oil and gas industry, and there are some [risks involved](http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/105182-midstream-mlps-continue-to-lose-favor-with-investors){:target="_blank"} in investing in the companies, of course.

*"Why aren't you buying midstream yet?"*

Some of the stocks I recommend in this space are EPD, NML, MMP, PAA, and SXL in that order.  Here's [an article](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13310310/1/9-midstream-oil-companies-that-are-unfairly-beaten-down.html){:target="_blank"} detailing more on most of those stocks.

# Details on the mentioned midstream stocks
The midstream stock I found that I really like is [NML (Neuberger Berman MLP Income Fund Inc)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSEMKT%3ANML&ei=5g5iV8iRHNTDjAGp1JXQAw){:target="_blank"}.  They actually focus on gas, but they are on the upswing after a beatdown.  Another is [SXL (Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P.)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ASXL&ei=8g5iV9nxFs-22Aaz24XIBA){:target="_blank"}, which is an oil and gas midstream company which seems to be going up again after a year-long sell-off.  One midstream stock that don't seem as discounted is [MMP (Magellan)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AMMP&sq=Magellan&sp=1&ei=gyBiV_GeL8mPjAHxjbDYBg){:target="_blank"}, but they have solid EPS and a good P/E ratio.  There's also [PAA (Plains All American)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3APAA&ei=FCFiV4HKEYWyjAHxn6GwCw){:target="_blank"} which is paying crazy dividends of 3% right now, and has crashed (but still has a low EPS and high P/E, so be careful), [EPD (Entreprise Products)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AEPD&sq=Enterprise%20Products&sp=2&ei=WyFiV8nfAsWtjAHcu6vABQ){:target="_blank"}, which seems to have a good balance of earnings, dividends, and a discounted price.  All of these stocks offer pretty high dividends, which is great in my opinion.  They're also paying higher dividends now because the stocks are down so much.

## Solar stocks
The CEO of SunRun ([RUN](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ARUN&sq=sunrun&sp=2&ei=1SJiV7n4M4aX2Ab7lLvICw){:target="_blank"}, Lynn Jurich, was also at the WSJ conference and spoke.  She said that currently there is essentially an unlimited supply of people that want to go off the grid and/or go solar that are calling their company.  However, Nevada's (and possibly some other states') utility companies have decreased their net-metering rates that they pay for solar power going into the grid.  They used to pay the same amount (or close to) what they charged the end customer, so if they sold electricity for $0.12/kWh, they would pay SunRun $0.12/kWh for the power they put back into the grid.  Recently they decreased this number dramatically, to something like $0.02/kWh, really hurting the SunRun business.  Is it a good buy right now?  I'm not sure.  I'd say 60% chance it goes up substantially in the long run, but there's a lot of bureaucratic risk involved, since laws and net-metering can change quickly.

Lynn Jurich, CEO of SunRun says there's virtually unquenchable demand for what she's selling.

## Yelp
I came across [this article](https://outfoxthestreet.whotrades.com/blog/43768380882?domain=s30095817685.whotrades.com){:target="_blank"}, which points out [Yelp](https://www.google.com/finance?q=yelp&ei=2CJiV9mGEMmPjAHxjbDYBg){:target="_blank"} has a lot of room to grow by selling ads. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital also just bought 3.2 million shares worth over $60 million, so that's a good sign of investor confidence.  The stock is also down 70% from it's high in 2014, so it looks like a bargain right now.
