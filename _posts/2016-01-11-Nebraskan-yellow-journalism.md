### Nebraskan cops and news reporters skew the truth

Recently, my dad was parroting the local news' claims that legalized cannabis in Colorado (specifically, the recreational variety, for which sales began at the beginning of 2014) is costing NE (Nebraska) taxpayers a LOT of money.  Oh dear!  Costing a lot of money?!  But how?  Where was this (mis)information coming from?  I decided to investigate...and what I found was these news networks and the people they interviewed were spreading misinformation based on a few anecdotes.  Shame on them!

The only way this could be costing Nebraskans money is if marijuana-related justice system costs increased *significantly*. There's [an excellent study](http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/nebraska-center-for-justice-research/documents/reduced-colorado-legalization.pdf) that came out recently, showing trends up to 2014.  First, lets look at how much it costs.  Estimated total costs for Marijuana-related jailings is about 1 million dollars; the border counties (who are complaining in the news stories) only cost about 10% of the total, although it's increased by a factor of 10 since 2000:

![dollars on MJ arrests.png](/images/stupidNE/dollars on MJ arrests.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Border counties make up a small fraction of total MJ arrest costs (about 10%).</center>*

However, all counties are down in costs recently, except the CO border counties.  In total, the state-wide cost is about flat.  Total NE justice system costs are near $800 million, so to say something that is costing about $1 million (0.125% of total costs) is a big problem is extremely dishonest and sensational.  

In fact, this is a recurring theme I'm finding in anti-marijuana campaigns--making a big deal about things increasing from 0.1% to 0.12%.  Another example is fatal car accidents which were claimed to be related to marijuana (I'm not sure if they tested blood for THC or Cannabinol levels--there is a BIG difference in what the two mean), which doubled recently from something like 37 to 74 per year (2013-2014).  Of course anything fatal is *always* a trajedy, and we would all like them to decrease (except, maybe Hitler).  With a state population of about 5 million people in CO, that's an absolute increase of 0.0007% to 0.0015% fatal marijuana-related car accidents.  Watch out, it's an epidemic!

[Another nice study](http://www.drugscience.org/States/NE/NE.pdf), using Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program data, looked at the total cost of Marijuana-related arrests.  They found that marijuana-related arrests could be costing up to $60 million, out of a total $800 million.  However, there are about 7,500 marijuana arrests per year, and only about 750 are jailed.  It seems this would mean most of the arrests don't hold water in court--and are a waste of time and money of police forces and courts, to the tune of some 10s of millions of dollars.

Now, let's look at what percentage of people jailed in Nebraska are due to cannabis:

![mj related pct.png](/images/stupidNE/mj related pct.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Arrests only increased in border counties so far. Might the police be looking harder for marijuana?</center>*

Oh no!  It's up so high in the border counties!  Not so fast.  Border counties only make up about 6% of total marijuana admissions (54 out of 963 in 2013).

![mj related admissions.png](/images/stupidNE/mj related admissions.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Marijuana admissions in border counties are a blip on the radar.</center>*

Out of the total jail admissions in Nebraska in 2013 (69420) marijuana-related admissions were only 1.4% (963).

There has been a 13% increase in [drug-related arrests from 2013 to 2014](https://ncc.nebraska.gov/sites/ncc.nebraska.gov/files/pdf/stats_and_research/14_Crime_In_Nebraska.pdf) from about 10,500 to about 12,000/year, but it's not clear if that's due to marijuana or not (the statistics are still being prepared).  However, drug-related arrests were on a steady rise from 1995 onward, and they had already been at 12,000 a year in 2002, so it's not like we're setting a huge new record of total drug-related arrests.  Sadly, in many Nebraska counties, possession of even one cannabis edible product (which can contain a miniscule amount of THC--around 5-20 mg, which is a single dose) is a felony, and [could get you jail time](http://netnebraska.org/article/news/938774/how-tough-nebraska-pot-possession-depends-county).  In Deuel County, the country attorney says, “Let’s say you have a marijuana brownie,” Johnathan Steller explained.  “We would prosecute you for the possession of hash which is a class 4 felony.”
![drug arrests.png](/images/stupidNE/drug arrests.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Drug-related arrests are as high as they've ever been, but no higher.</center>*

There has also not been a large increase in NE prison population in recent years (since 2007), and the number of **inmates in jail due to drugs** (and specifically Marijuana) **has been either flat or decreasing since 2007**.  Furthermore, **Nebraskans could save *10s of millions of dollars per year* if they at least decriminalized the [selling/manufacture/concentrates aspects of cannabis penalties](http://norml.org/laws/item/nebraska-penalties-2)**.  (Penalties for selling to minors should remain.)  When it was decriminalized in CA, somewhere in the range of [26 to 74 million dollars were saved per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States#State_Office_of_Narcotics_and_Drug_Abuse_.281977.29).  If it was made legal in NE, some tax revenue could be enjoyed, as with Colorado and other states.  Legalization also means people would be more free instead of less free--after all, isn't this supposed to be the land of the free?  (Well actually, it's just the free-ish.)

*<center>Durr...really?</center>*

First of all, it's worth noting that Cannabis was made illegal by a number of factors, one of which was Randolf Hearst's famous "yellow journalism"--journalism that is based upon sensationalism and crude exaggeration.  Rumors were spread that claimed consuming cannabis caused people to go completely, irreversibly insane and go on murdering sprees (with no evidence to back up these sensational stories), using Hearst's newspaper empire.  It's worth spending a little time reading up on [how it became illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States).  Back to the present...

Around May of 2014, a couple of Nebraskan news networks came out with some stories regarding Cannabis.  One was from [KETV](http://www.ketv.com/news/Colorado-marijuana-costing-Nebraska-taxpayers/25868850), in which reporter Dave Roberts quips, "With each moment, Colorado marijuana costs Nebraska taxpayers a little bit more."  They interview a single cop, who keeps spewing anecdotal BS about how much more it's costing Nebraska now that Ganja is legal in Colorado.  During the whole news story, not one single piece of statistical evidence--such as number of arrests, number of people jailed, etc, is presented.  Not a single number!  It's all vague claims to "how much more it's costing Nebraskan tax-payers now" with zero evidence, other than a few weak stories from a single cop.  The cop keeps talking about how "...we're payin' for them to be housed, we're payin' for 'em to be fed, we're paying for their medic--if they have medical expenses, which, a lot of them do..." These sound like unfounded stories, and there's no statistical evidence to back *any* of if up.  It's reminiscent of yellow journalism to me.

![smug cop.png](/images/stupidNE/smug cop.png){: .center-image }
*<center>He's smirking because he just beat up a crippled hippie.</center>*

One of my favorite parts of this news clip is when they interview some seemingly random, goofy-ass dude (actually NE Senator Ken Schilz, who I kinda like because [he's anti-daylight savings time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schilz)), who says, ["do we soften up for the folks so we don't cost too much money to ourselves, or do we maintain our principles, and take it in the shorts money-wise?"](https://youtu.be/SZls2ioUqqc).  What, you mean your principles of incarcerating practically innocent people in overcrowded prisons, who many times have committed a victimless crime, which--by the way--could be costing 10s of millions of dollars per year?  So your telling me we should give people a [minimum sentence of 1 year and up to 20 years just for growing a plant in their house](http://norml.org/laws/item/nebraska-penalties-2), or giving some to their friends?  Or having a few brownies with THC in them?  Wasting money and arresting mostly harmless people--great principles, guy.

![moron.png](/images/stupidNE/moron.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Mr. "principles". <a href="https://youtu.be/SZls2ioUqqc">Here's the video.</a></center>*

A World-Herald staff writer also [wrote an article](http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska-on-its-own-with-drug-enforcement-costs-tied-to/article_d76f74a4-b109-5080-9d7b-4e26264686bc.html#nebraska-on-its-own-with-drug-enforcement-costs-tied-to-colorado-pot-sales), this one with at least a few numbers in it.  Conveniently, it was posted on 4-20-2014!  Did they do that on purpose?  (In case you don't know the significance of 4-20 to cannabis connoisseurs, [read up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture))).  They did provide some useful numbers in the report: "As of last week, the Nebraska State Patrol had seized 997 pounds of marijuana this year. That's 281 pounds less than the amount confiscated during the same period in 2013, said Deb Collins, a patrol spokeswoman."  Back in 2001, almost [5,000 pounds were siezed](http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4934/marijuan.htm), and more recently, [about 3,000-4,000 lbs were siezed](http://www.klkntv.com/story/27646292/pot-busts-down-money-seized-up?clienttype=mobile).  So, let me get this straight--less cannabis was seized, but somehow you claim the costs of enforcement are going up?  That makes no sense.  

Another thing the same lame cop as before says is that "Our DUID, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, has went up dramatically compared to last few years..." because people are consuming cannabis while they drive.  So, I checked the DUI statistics (I assume DUIDs fall under DUI since I couldn't find separate DUID statistics).  Turns out, NE DUIs have been [steadily going down since 2004](http://www.transportation.nebraska.gov/nohs/pdf/al5arrests.pdf)--the chubby cop with poor grammar is wrong again.
![DUIs.png](/images/stupidNE/DUIs.png){: .center-image }
*<center>DUIs went down recently, not up.</center>*

Then there's [this series on the subject](http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Special-Report---Nebraska-v-Colorado-The-War-on-Weed-295996161.html), with a ridiculous quote by the Nebraska Attorney-General: 

“The information we get in the attorney general's office is this is bringing in the cartels from Mexico,” said Nebraska AG Doug Peterson. “They think they sanctified the process and the cartels went away. They're coming in stronger. I recently heard today that the Russian cartels are here to compete for the market. It's a terrible social experiment.”

That's a ridiculous claim to make based on some rumor you "recently heard today".  Did someone at the news station tell you that info?  Because that's what it basically sounds like, if you just **recently** heard it **today**.

Based on these news stories, the general Nebraskan anti-cannabis attitude, and my Dad's adamant anti-weed stance, I decided to investigate some prison statistics.  First, let it be known that CO legalized medicinal marijuana in the year 2000, and legalized recreational cannabis in 2013.  Based on these news stories from 2014, we should see a large jump in prison population, and specifically for marijuana-related offenses.  The Nebraska corrections department [publishes some numbers](http://www.corrections.nebraska.gov/news.html), and it looks like the overall prison population has slightly increased since 2005, jumping up about 10% in 2012.
![total_corrections.png](/images/stupidNE/total_corrections.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Nebraska prison population is basically flat since 2005.</center>*

If we look deeper, we can see that the number of offenders in prison for drugs has stayed flat or decreased since 2007 (and specifically for manufacture/concentrates/selling of drugs in the case of the females--they have more specific data).
![female-drugs.png](/images/stupidNE/female-drugs.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Looks like a flat line or downslope to me.</center>*

![male-drugs.png](/images/stupidNE/male-drugs.png){: .center-image }
*<center>This one has a slightly negative slope.</center>*

Given that nearly all of the NE prisons are overcrowded by 50% to 100% (average population compared with design capacity), making cannabis legal, or at least a little more decriminalized would help alleviate strain on the NE prison system.  Furthermore, the average cost of supporting an inmate is around 35,000 per year, according to the [prison reports](http://www.corrections.nebraska.gov/news.html).  Assuming about half the inmates for manufacture/concentrates/selling of drugs are there for Marijuana-related infractions (based on the Female population data), this would mean about 165 inmates in the NE prison system are there for Marijuana.  If we decided to make cannabis legal, and let these people free (and not arrest any more), it could save Nebraska taxpayers up to 10s of millions of dollars per year.  As a caveat, I don't know the specifics of the drug charges these people are in for.  If they are selling to minors, then I would say they deserve it. If it's a different marijuana-related crime, I'd say it's a waste of taxpayer money to lock them up.

Finally, I think it's sound to say that smoking *anything* is extremely bad for you, and should only be done on rare occasion.  If you want to consume cannabis, use another method.  Vaporization is better than smoking, and eating or drinking an infused product is probably the best possible way to consume cannabis.  However, make sure you [understand how to properly consume an edible](http://mashable.com/2015/04/19/weed-edibles-dosage/#cUiG.JTqlPqU)--if you have too much, you're going to have a really bad time.  For starters, only consume 1mg, and wait a few hours.  Then, if desired, you can up your dose by 1mg next time, always waiting a few hours to see how intense the effects are.
