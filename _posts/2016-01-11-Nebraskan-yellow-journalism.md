### Nebraskan cops and news reporters skew the truth

Recently, my dad was parroting the local news' claims that legalized cannabis in Colorado (specifically, the recreational variety, legalized January 1st, 2013) is costing Nebraska taxpayers a LOT of money.  Oh dear!  Costing a lot of money?!  But how?  Where was this (mis)information coming from?  I decided to investigate...and what I found was exactly the opposite.  

The only way this could be costing Nebraskans money is if there were a lot more arrests and peopled jailed since January 1st, 2013.  There has been **NO** large increase in NE (Nebraska) prison population in recent years (since 2007), and the number of **inmates in jail due to drugs** (and specifically Marijuana) **has been either flat or decreasing since 2007**.  Furthermore, **Nebraskans could save around *11 million dollars per year* if they at least decriminalized the selling of cannabis**.  (However, it would be a good idea to keep penalties for selling to minors.)  When it was decriminalized in CA, somewhere in the range of [26 to 74 million dollars were saved per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States#State_Office_of_Narcotics_and_Drug_Abuse_.281977.29).  If it was made legal in NE, some tax revenue could be enjoyed, as with Colorado and other states.  Legalization also means people would be more free instead of less free--after all, isn't this supposed to be the land of the free?  (Well actually, it's just the free-ish.)

First of all, it's worth noting that Cannabis was made illegal by a number of factors, one of which was Randolf Hearst's famous "yellow journalism"--journalism that is based upon sensationalism and crude exaggeration.  Rumors were spread that claimed consuming cannabis caused people to go completely, irreversibly insane and go on murdering sprees (with no evidence to back up these sensational stories), using Hearst's newspaper empire.  It's worth spending a little time reading up on [how it became illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States).  Back to the present...

Around May of 2014, a couple of Nebraskan news networks came out with some stories regarding Cannabis.  One was from [KETV](http://www.ketv.com/news/Colorado-marijuana-costing-Nebraska-taxpayers/25868850), in which reporter Dave Roberts quips, "With each moment, Colorado marijuana costs Nebraska taxpayers a little bit more."  They interview a single cop, who keeps spewing anecdotal BS about how much more it's costing Nebraska now that Ganja is legal in Colorado.  During the whole news story, not one single piece of statistical evidence--such as number of arrests, number of people jailed, etc, is presented.  Not a single number!  It's all vague claims to "how much more it's costing Nebraskan tax-payers now" with zero evidence, other than a few weak stories from a single cop.  The cop keeps talking about how "...we're payin' for them to be housed, we're payin' for 'em to be fed, we're paying for their medic--if they have medical expenses, which, a lot of them do..." These sound like unfounded stories, and there's no statistical evidence to back *any* of if up.  It seems like yellow journalism to me.

One of my favorite parts of this news clip is when they interview some seemingly random, goofy-ass dude (actually NE Senator Ken Schilz, who I kinda like because [he's anti-daylight savings time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schilz)), who says, "do we soften up for the folks so we don't cost too much money to ourselves, or do we maintain our principles, and take it in the shorts money-wise?".  What, you mean your principles of incarcerating practically innocent people in overcrowded prisons, who many times have committed a victimless crime, which--by the way--is costing somewhere around 11 million dollars per year?  Wasting money and arresting mostly harmless people--great principles, guy.

![moron.png](/images/stupidNE/moron.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Mr. "principles". <a href="https://youtu.be/SZls2ioUqqc">Here's the video.</a></center>*

A World-Herald staff writer also [wrote an article](http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska-on-its-own-with-drug-enforcement-costs-tied-to/article_d76f74a4-b109-5080-9d7b-4e26264686bc.html#nebraska-on-its-own-with-drug-enforcement-costs-tied-to-colorado-pot-sales), this one with at least a few numbers in it.  Conveniently, it was posted on 4-20-2014!  Did they do that on purpose?  (In case you don't know the significance of 4-20 to cannabis connoisseurs, [read up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture))).  They did provide some useful numbers in the report: "As of last week, the Nebraska State Patrol had seized 997 pounds of marijuana this year. That's 281 pounds less than the amount confiscated during the same period in 2013, said Deb Collins, a patrol spokeswoman."  Back in 2001, almost [5,000 pounds were siezed](http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4934/marijuan.htm), and more recently, [about 3,000-4,000 lbs were siezed](http://www.klkntv.com/story/27646292/pot-busts-down-money-seized-up?clienttype=mobile).  So, let me get this straight--less cannabis was seized, but somehow you claim the costs of enforcement are going up?  That makes no sense.  

Another thing the same lame cop as before says is that "Our DUID, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, has went up dramatically compared to last few years..." because people are consuming cannabis while they drive.  So, I checked the DUI statistics (I assume DUIDs fall under DUI since I couldn't find separate DUID statistics).  Turns out, NE DUIs have been [steadily going down since 2004](http://www.transportation.nebraska.gov/nohs/pdf/al5arrests.pdf)--the chubby cop with poor grammar is wrong again.

*<center>DUIs went down recently, not up.</center>*

Then there's [this series on the subject](http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Special-Report---Nebraska-v-Colorado-The-War-on-Weed-295996161.html), with a ridiculous quote by the Nebraska Attorney-General: 

“The information we get in the attorney general's office is this is bringing in the cartels from Mexico,” said Nebraska AG Doug Peterson. “They think they sanctified the process and the cartels went away. They're coming in stronger. I recently heard today that the Russian cartels are here to compete for the market. It's a terrible social experiment.”

That's a ridiculous claim to make based on some rumor you "recently heard today".  Did someone at the news station tell you that info?  Because that's what it basically sounds like, if you just **recently** heard it **today**.

Based on these news stories, the general Nebraskan anti-cannabis attitude, and my Dad's adamant anti-weed stance, I decided to investigate some prison statistics.  First, let it be known that CO legalized medicinal marijuana in the year 2000, and legalized recreational cannabis in 2013.  Based on these news stories from 2014, we should see a large jump in prison population, and specifically for marijuana-related offenses.  The Nebraska corrections department [publishes some numbers](http://www.corrections.nebraska.gov/news.html), and it looks like the overall prison population has slightly increased since 2005, jumping up about 10% in 2012.
![total_corrections.png](/images/stupidNE/total_corrections.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Nebraska prison population is basically flat since 2005.</center>*

If we look deeper, we can see that the number of offenders in prison for drugs has stayed flat or decreased since 2007 (and specifically for marijuana in the case of the females--they have more specific data).
![female-drugs.png](/images/stupidNE/female-drugs.png){: .center-image }
*<center>Looks like a flat line to me.</center>*

![male-drugs.png](/images/stupidNE/male-drugs.png){: .center-image }
*<center>This one has a slightly negative slope.</center>*

Given that nearly all of the NE prisons are overcrowded by 50% to 100% (average population compared with design capacity), making cannabis legal, or at least decriminalized would greatly alleviate strain on the NE prison system.  Furthermore, the average cost of supporting an inmate is around 35,000 per year, according to the [prison reports](http://www.corrections.nebraska.gov/news.html).  Assuming about half the inmates for drugs are there for Marijuana-related infractions (based on the Female population data), this would mean about 330 inmates in the NE prison system are there for Marijuana.  If we decided to make cannabis legal, and let these people free (and not arrest any more), it would save Nebraska taxpayers about 11 million dollars per year.
