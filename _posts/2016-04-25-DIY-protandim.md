## Protandim

Recently I was introduced to a nutriceutical called [Protandim by a company called LifeVantage](http://www.lifevantage.com/){:target="_blank"}.  The company works via [Network Marketing (Multi-level Marketing, MLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing){:target="_blank"} someone who's already a distrubuter in the company can help you sign up, and they make you [watch this video first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTBpSjiTWv0){:target="_blank"}.  There's also this [video by Joe McCord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_45LiaZzt8w&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}, who was a scientist involved in the study (and maybe development, I'm unsure).  Of course, I was skeptical of the product, and still am (especially after reading the [wiki article on the scientific research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protandim#Research){:target="_blank"}).  The whole company gives me a weird cult-like vibe, and comes off as a bit scammy to me.

When I went to buy a bottle on the site, the payment page looked like this:

![payment page](/images/payment page.png){: .center-image}

What's with the "...secured by CHASE" line.  Doesn't look very official or reassuring...When I then went to cancel my monthly autoship, I had to call in to the company.  This also makes it feel like a scam to me, or at least slimy and not straightforward.

There seems to be a lot of conflicting viewpoints out there about the drug, like [this](http://protandimretort.com/protandim-dr-mccord-inventor-vs-paul-myhill/){:target="_blank"} vs [this](http://xuworldwide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lifevantage-Written-by-LazyMan.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [this](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/brief-update-protandim/){:target="_blank"}.  There's also [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20101114031418/http://www.lazymanandmoney.com/lifevantage-protandim-scam) that LifeVantage sued to have removed from the internet, calling it slander or false information, I think.  There's a number of other reviews I've found ([1](http://supplement-geek.com/protandim-research-review-lifevantage/){:target="_blank"}, [2](http://themedicineguy.com/protandim-life-extender-or-money-waster/){:target="_blank"}, [3](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/protandim-another-kind-of-antioxidant/){:target="_blank"}) that generally don't have a strong opinion one way or another.  There's a ton of [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=protandim){:target="_blank"} on the subject, of course.

The funny thing is the patents protecting Protandim ([here's one](https://www.google.com/patents/US7923045?dq=protandim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIp_SvgavMAhXHxIMKHeCTD5IQ6AEIHDAA){:target="_blank"}) specify an *extract* must be used (except for ashwagandha), with some minimum amount of the active ingredient from each of the five ingredients.  Here's the ingredients, active chemicals, and amounts required:

| Raw ingredient | Active Chemical(s) | Minimum dose of active chemical(s) | active material % of raw material | Corresponding Amount of Raw Ingredient
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bacopa powder  | Bacosides  | 30 mg | 8% | 375 mg
| Milk thistle powder or seeds  | Silymarin  | 158 mg | 2% | 7.9 g |
| Ashwagandha powder  | [ashwagandhine, etc](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/ashwagandha-root-powder/profile){:target="_blank"}  | 150 mg | 100% | 150 mg |
| Green tea (matcha)  | polyphenol  | 74 mg | 10% | 0.74 g |
| Turmeric powder  | curcumin  | 71 mg | 3% | 2.37 g |


I made the assumptions about amount of active ingredients from here: [bacopa - 8% bacosides](https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/){:target="_blank"}, [milk thistle seeds - 2% silymarin](https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa-monnieri/){:target="_blank"}, [green tea - 10% polyphenols](http://www.teatech.com/faqs.php){:target="_blank"}, [turmeric powder - 3% curcumin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17044766){:target="_blank"}.

Now, some of these powders taste pretty bad on there own.  Hmm, how to make them not taste bad...I googled 'how to make ashwagandha not taste bad' after trying some of the powder mixed with water, and the [best suggestion I found was to mix up the powder with honey](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-consume-Ashwagandha-powder){:target="_blank"}.

I tried mixing ashwagandha with about 5x honey, and it was still pretty bitter and not very good.  I found that for all the powders, a ratio of 1:10 powder:honey was enough to mask the taste for me (except turmeric still had a bit of a spicy taste with the honey).  This means we need 111 g of honey for a daily dose using only powders--which is about 300 calories and 80 grams of sugar; way too much.  Instead, let's use the raw milk thistle seeds.  They have a slightly savory/minty taste with bitterness, and are pretty hard.  I would bet soaking them in water for 24 hours (and maybe roasting them afterwords would really help the taste and texture.  Add some other seeds (almonds, sunflower, etc), and we have a nice little breakfast or morning snack/dessert.

The overall recipe turned out to be:

| servings                        | 30      |      |
|---------------------------------|---------|------|
| item                            | amount  | unit |
| bacopa powder                   | 11.25   | g    |
| milk thistle seeds              | 237     | g    |
| ashwagandha powder              | 4.5     | g    |
| matcha green tea powder         | 22.2    | g    |
| turmeric powder                 | 71.1    | g    |
| total mass                      | 346.05  | g    |
| total mass (w/o milk thistle seeds) | 109.05  | g    |
| honey                           | 1090.5  | g    |
| honey                           | 768 | ml   |
| honey                           | 3 1/4     | cups |

I haven't added the cost of any other seeds yet.  Sunflower seeds are super cheap though.
So far, I've tried this with honey, turmeric, ashwagandha, and green tea.  Everything was alright, except the turmeric powder stained my tongue a nasty yellow.  Since the amount of active ingredient (curcumin) in turmeric is very low ([3% curcumin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17044766){:target="_blank"}), it makes more sense to buy the extract, at least for turmeric.  However, as soon as you use turmeric extract and ashwagandha powder together, technically, you are violating [the patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US7923045?dq=protandim&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIp_SvgavMAhXHxIMKHeCTD5IQ6AEIHDAA){:target="_blank"}.

The honey and milk thistle are by far the most expensive components.  To drop the price, milk thistle can be [bought at a discount at higher volumes](http://www.herbco.com/p-380-milk-thistle-seed-whole.aspx?test=zeros&utm_expid=8790734-0.3AeVqw8lSiWXCekb73M-rw.1&gclid=CjwKEAjwgPe4BRCB66GG8PO69QkSJAC4EhHhS3iCKx-efUbnlDksK3ApFaSmpyqYHM1l0yiEnYzGAhoCLyzw_wcB&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F){:target="_blank"} (cut price is half at least), [so can honey](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/monarchs-choice-bakers-special-honey-60-lb-pail/789HONBAKE60.html?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&gclid=CjwKEAjwgPe4BRCB66GG8PO69QkSJAC4EhHhy6P7wW0oKPYBUF5oEGUEJ9pddzW8uF8tHZOJdU44mBoC0kXw_wcB){:target="_blank"} (drop the price by 1/3).

You can also order curcumin and milk thistle extract, so the amount of those powders isn't so high.  However, that is then violating the patent.  But it's not like they're going to come after you in your kitchen if you're mixing this up for yourself, not that I'm advocating that (because I legally can't, of course), but this wouldn't be that hard to make (hypothetically):

The total cost ends up being pretty cheap ($0.19 / day, about 1/7 of the cost of the Protandim pill at $1.33 / day), and the amount of honey is drastically reduced, meaning only 23 calories and 6 g of sugar from the honey, per day.  Compared with the cost of $1.33 / day for Protandim, this becomes much cheaper, but you would have to put in more labor.  The way I would make it is to combine the honey mixture with something else, bake it into bars, and cut up the bars to properly does out the mixture.  Easy and tasty.

Interestingly, the prices for the extract (per serving) are cheaper than the raw material.  Doesn't make sense to me, since extra processing is needed for the extracts, but oh well.  For the curcumin extract, I put one in there that also has piperine (which increases the bioavailability of curcumin).

I've also ordered some Protandim to give it a shot.  According to the first research paper on it, I would expect to feel something in a week or two.  However, after taking it for a month, I haven't noticed any effects.  Perhaps it does nothing for me.
