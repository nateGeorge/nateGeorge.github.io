## New cowboys on the scene

While ordering more Shinyei PPD42NS particle sensors off of aliexpress, I noticed a bunch of other particle sensors that I hadn't seen before.  It would appear measuring air quality is becoming more popular!  I even found a [full-on portable air quality monitor](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Household-PM2-5-detector-air-quality-monitor-Dust-Haze-measurement-PM2-5-sensor/32379763588.html?spm=2114.01020208.3.18.mH9p2A&ws_ab_test=201526_3,201527_4_71_72_73_74_75,201409_4), but it appears it's not wifi-connected, and apparantly has no documentation (common for Chinese goods).  It's by a company called [Plantower](http://www.plantower.com/) out of China.

There's also [this](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-precision-laser-PM2-5-particle-mass-concentration-sensor-A3-dust-dust-sensors/32380393457.html?spm=2114.01020208.3.2.lhfMRU&ws_ab_test=201526_3,201527_4_71_72_73_74_75,201409_4), which I think is by Plantower too, the [SDS011](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-PM2-5-Air-particle-dust-sensor-SDS011-laser-inside-digital-output-SAMPLE-module-air/32452894732.html?spm=2114.01020208.3.2.Elo2TY&ws_ab_test=201526_3,201527_4_71_72_73_74_75,201409_4), the [SM-PWM-01](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/SM-PWM-01-High-precision-PM2-5-dust-sensor-SM-PWM-01A-Including-cable/32304579666.html) (which is another ripoff of the Shinyei PPD42NS), [the INSAN CP-15-A3](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-precision-laser-PM2-5-particle-mass-concentration-sensor-A3-dust-dust-sensors-INSAN-CP-15/32425440516.html) all in Chinese, and the [PMS3003](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Laser-Dust-Sensor-Module-PM1-0-PM2-5-PM10-Adapter-Board-Can-Be-Connected-Free-Shipping/32387876788.html).

Of course there's the Shinyei PPD42NS and it's first ripoff, the Samyoung DSM501A, which have been out for a while.
