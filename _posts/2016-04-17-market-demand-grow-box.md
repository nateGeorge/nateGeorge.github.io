One business idea I'm exploring is a mostly-automated growbox for plants in general.  With the market price for marijuana so high (pun intended) at $1500-$4000 per pound, the first market that makes the most sense to go after is the cannabis crowd.  [Leaf](http://www.getleaf.co/) came out with a pretty stellar product aimed at cannabis users, so the only room to grow is by attacking a different niche, making it cheaper, or aestetically much different.  I decided to do a bit of market research on this to see what the possibilities are.

The Colorado DOR [published a report](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj8w4KA4KXMAhXhmIMKHTG5DIkQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.colorado.gov%2Fpacific%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FMarket%2520Size%2520and%2520Demand%2520Study%2C%2520July%25209%2C%25202014%255B1%255D.pdf&usg=AFQjCNE4nIzFdk9ntkf26VJXsFBe0jtuvg&sig2=-58l0FaZoIQkai3HWHWZ4w&bvm=bv.119745492,d.amc) in early 2014 regarding the market potential for marijuana (cannabis with THC).

There are about 200,000 people in Colorado who use marijuana on a daily basis, and they consume about 1 pound per year.  I'm really curious to know the demographics of these people, and if there are many successful people in that crowd, or people with high incomes.  Right now it's hard to say what this average daily user looks like.  My guess would be 75% male and an average income of 50k per year or less.

###Yields
This means a steady supply of bud for these people would be about 2 oz per month (for a total of 24 oz = 1.5 pounds, so they can share some with friends/family).  Cannabis being approximately on a 3-month harvest cycle means each harvest should produce about 4-6 oz, about 1/4 to 3/8 of a pound (115-170 g).  

###Electricity costs
The industry standard for yield per Watt of lighting is about 1 g/W each harvest, meaning we need about 150 W of lighting power.  A small pump will water the plants in a pseudo-hydroponic system, taking only a few more Watts.  Assuming we need some more Watts for other electronics (wifi MCU, fan for lights, etc), bank on 200W of power being used.  This means electricity costs are about $10/month and $30 per harvest.  Nutrients will probably cost about $30 for a harvest.  The machine will cost probably $600 total, meaning the cost for 1 pound of cannabis over a year is about $840 in the first year, and $240 in each year thereafter.  The LED lights should last about 5 years, meaning about 5 pounds will be grown for about $400 per pound.  Even if someone is paying on average $20/eight of an ounce, that's $2560 per pound, and $12,800 over 5 years time.  With the grow box, it's only about $1,500 over 5 years, meaning these people would save $10,800 over 5 years.  That'll buy someone a pretty nice car!

###Size
Usually 2 pounds are grown in 20 square feet every 3 months, so we will need an area of about 2 feet on a side, and about 4 feet high.  Add a few extra feet for the water reservoir, coming out to 6 feet high.

###Realistic
I've personally grown about 12 oz in 3-4 months in a hydroponic system with a 300W LED light.  The size was about 3x3x6ft, and I started from seeds, and grew 3 plants.

###Financials
Assuming we can sell to %50 of the daily-user population, we should be able to sell 100,000 units in Colorado alone.  Assuming we are making 5x profit margins on the raw materials, that's $800 on each growbox for $80M in gross revenue.  The unit can be used for other plants as well (coffee, tomatoes, basil, other herbs, etc) meaning sales can be done nationwide.

###Function
Having two boxes is ideal, because the plant can be cured right in the grow box under light (which helps heat and dry the plant).  I was inspired to do this by a friend from Santa Barbara, CA, who told a story about finding some weed in the Santa Barbara mountains.  Once when he was hiking, he came across a cannabis plant that was fully grown with flowers.  It had been perfectly cured in the sun, and he simply cracked off some nugs to take with him.  The same sun-curing step will be possible in this apparatus, which takes an extra 1-2 weeks.  Final curing over another few weeks is typically done mason jars.

###Maintenance sucks
Part of the point is to automate as much as possible, and minimize maintenance.  That is why LEDs will be used.  Periodic water flushes are automated, as well as nutrient dosing and pH balancing.  The only intervention that is required is weekly or bi-weekly water addition and water flushing, which should take about 5 minutes.  At the beginning of each grow, nutrient/pH mix also has to be added (and calibrated once yearly).

###Add-ons
Various add-ons are possible, like CO2, custom lighting, and outside skins to name a few.  The nutrients, mason jars, and cloning equipment can also be sold as accessories.

###Material costs
So far it's looking like $125 just for the lighting.  The MCU could be $5-20 depending on what we want to do, the structure itself will probably be around $60.  Other various electronics will probably be around $30.  Total is $215 retail, round up to $250, hopefully can cut that in half with wholesale.  This means we probably have to sell it for $1,000 to start.  If scale-up is achieved, we could sell it for $600.

I think these boxes need to be made for a really low cost though, because eventually the price per pound of cannabis will come way down.  Right now, the cost is highly inflated due to the legality.  For example, the [price of tobacco is about $2 a pound](https://weather.com/farming/news/tobacco-crop-20121120).  I don't see marijuana being that much different from tobacco, so I expect once nationwide legaliaztion hits sometime in the next 10 years, we will see plummeting prices, and these growboxes will need to be extremely cheap to make any sense for the consumer.
