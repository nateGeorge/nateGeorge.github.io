Something particularly interesting I noticed is that while the rates of smoking have [gone down significantly](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2012/02/cigarette-smoking-another-factor-in.html):

the rates of lung and bronchial cancer [have gone up massively, especially for men:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21166/pdf):

I can't help but think some of that is from pollution, but the smoking and cancer death curves for men look shockinly similar, just offset by 30 years.
