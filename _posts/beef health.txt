Increasing n − 3 contents in beef can be relevant to improving human supply with n − 3 LC-PUFA ( Razminowicz et al., 2006). Raes, Balcean, Dirink, De Winne, Claeys, and Demeyer (2003) reported that n − 6/n − 3 ratios were higher (5–7) for animals fattened under highly intensive production conditions, compared with values of 2.5–3 for animals from extensive production systems. The recommended maximum n − 6/n − 3 is 5:1 ( Razminowicz et al., 2006)

bulletproof says there is too much omega6 in grain-fed and not enough CLA

well, turns out only the 'rump' cut studied had more CLA

grain-fed does not exceed the 5:1 omega6-omega3 ratio, which seems to be the maximum for health reasons (The recommended maximum n − 6/n − 3 is 5:1 ( Razminowicz et al., 2006, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174006000209).)
