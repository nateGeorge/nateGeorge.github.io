## Smoking makes you dumb

So it turns out smoking cannabis makes you stupid!  In this decisive study published in the well-respected scientific journal, PNAS, the authors tracked IQ and 
amount of ganja smoked for 1000 people.  Major conclusions: smoking herb for 20+ years and starting before you are 18 will decrease your IQ by a full 10 points.
The decrease is less severe if you don't start smoking until after 18, but any amount of smoking will cause a decrease in your IQ.  I wondered though, how 
much of this is due to the actual THC/cannibus chemical concotion entering the bloodstream, and how much is due to inhaling enormous amounts of unfiltered 
smoke? In my recent health quests, I've become more aware of air quality, and noticed how it's hard to even tell if air quality is poor (you don't even really 
notice).  So being that herb smokers proudly inhale huge quantities of thick smoke, I would think that could effect the quality of their brain and intelligence.

So I checked if just smoking causes lower intelligence--and yes, it does, by about 7.5 points.  (http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/23/us-smokers-smarter-idUSTRE61M3UQ20100223)
The other 2.5 points could be due to the chemicals in weed--or, my guess is that it is because weed smokers smoke unfiltered plant material.
The only way to settle this question would be to do a test with edible-only users vs smokers vs non-smokers.

Counter-point: this canadian study says only heavy users will be dumber.  Light and former users are smarter? Only assessed at ages 17-20 though.
