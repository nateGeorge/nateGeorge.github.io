### Supremacist police

My friend Andre was arrested by the Boulder, CO police, because he looked 'suspicious' while jogging with his young son to kindergarden.  He's a tall arabic guy, bald head with a beard. He and his son were running to school, training for a marathon (the [BolderBOULDER](http://www.bolderboulder.com/)), and holding hands.

He confronted the police, asked for an apology and an explanation to his son that they had made a mistake, but they would admit no fault.  He asked what was suspicious about his appearance that warranted his arrest; they first said 'it was the time and place you were at'.  He was dropping off his son at school, at the same time all the other parents were doing so.  Then he said that's not legitimate, so they said 'it was your attire'.  He was wearing running gear.  They then claimed 'you were holding your son's hand too tightly'.  Then he finally said to them 'admit it, you arrested me because I'm arabic.  You're racist!'.   But they denied, denied, denied.
