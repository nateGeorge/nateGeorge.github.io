## Ozone

Intro
When I was living in the bay area, near Milpitas (Milpit-ASS), I become concerned with air pollution.  I started measuring particle concentration in the air (1um, and 0.5um), 
and found the air quality was very poor much of the time.  I hypothesized ozone would also be an issue, since there are so many cars here (7 million people driving every day 
an average of 30 minutes -- 3.5 million car-hours/day).  I bought the MQ-131 sensor on aliexpress.com, and went to look for a tutorial to set it up.  All I found were junk tutorials, 
like this one () .  Commercial ozone meters cost hundreds or thousands of dollars(http://www.ozonesolutions.com/products/Ambient-Ozone), could we get nearly the same device for 10s of dollars?
Many ozone devices measure the amount of ozone by the absorption of 254nm radiation from a Hg-lamp (


Health Effects
It appears negative health effects begin around 1 ppm (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0476.pdf).  Depending on the situation, 120 ppm (2 hours of athletics), 
300 ppm (2 hours chillin'), 60 ppm (8 hours exposure) can be harmful (http://www.epa.gov/apti/ozonehealth/population.html#levels).  
In one study, hospital admissions for respiratory causes appear to follow a linear relationship down to background levels (http://www.epa.gov/apti/ozonehealth/images/brtfig9-5thumb.gif).

Hooking up
There are a few data sheets out there (https://www.futurlec.com/Datasheet/Sensor/MQ-131.pdf, http://www.thaieasyelec.net/archives/Manual/MQ-131.pdf), 
but the best I've found is this one, because it has the calibration curve as well as temp/humidity 
corrections (http://www.cooking-hacks.com/skin/frontend/default/cooking/pdf/MQ-131.pdf).

First, just make the simple connections as shown in the datasheet for the raw sensor, 
or buy one already on a board.  Vcc is 5V.  http://wiring.org.co/learning/basics/airqualitymq135.html, http://www.cooking-hacks.com/skin/frontend/default/cooking/pdf/MQ-131.pdf
You have to wait for it to heat up for 48hours first.  
The Hanwei datasheet says the sensitivity is only 10-1000ppm, which is 10 times greater than the human health hazard levels.
The other no-name datasheet says sensitivity is 10-2000ppb, which is relevant to health.  It gives the same So which is it?

The datasheet shows a calibration curve with resistance, yet we can only measure voltage with the analog pin on arduino (or other microcontrollers).  As 
long as current is constant, it should be ok.  I measured the current of the device a few times, and it seems to be constant at about 110mA, all the way from 1.5V to 2.5V.
After 12hrs, in a closed room, reading 2.95-3.1V.  A lot of drift in the signal, probably from air currents.  Same after 48 hours.

I emailed the Hanwei company that manufactures the device, they said there are two types: a low-concentration and high-concentration one.  The low concentration 
device looks like so:

while the high concentration device look like so:



The other issue is calibrating the R0 value.  To get a clean measurement, I basically shut all the windows to my room for a whole night, and assumed to ozone was in there after that.  
A better calibration will have to be done in the future, probably with 

Moving on
There's another sensor for a little bit more dough, that can do 10ppb to 1000ppb (MiCS-2610). (http://microcontrollershop.com/product_info.php?products_id=6791&gclid=Cj0KEQjwuLKtBRDPicmJyvu_qZMBEiQAzlGN5ivUhiSjXgYoKoxewa4vszh8J5XnP0YMdmQMcbcTA3QaAs_R8P8HAQ)
datasheet: http://pub.ucpros.com/download/1087_Datasheet-MiCS-26142.pdf

There's yet another sensor, the O3-B4 datasheet: (http://www.alphasense.com/WEB1213/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/O3B4.pdf), which has been researched 
by a lab (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/default/files/lb-na-26681-en-n.pdf)
