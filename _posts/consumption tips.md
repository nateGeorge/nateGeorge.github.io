Finally, I think it's sound to say that smoking *anything* is extremely bad for you, and should only be done on rare occasion.  If you want to consume cannabis, use another method.  Vaporization is better than smoking, and eating or drinking an infused product is probably the best possible way to consume cannabis.  However, make sure you [understand how to properly consume an edible](http://mashable.com/2015/04/19/weed-edibles-dosage/#cUiG.JTqlPqU){:target="_blank"}--if you have too much, you're going to have a really bad time.  For starters, only consume 1 mg of THC, and wait a few hours.  Then, if desired, you can up your dose by 1mg next time, always waiting a few hours to see how intense the effects are.  It's always better to take THC in conjunction with CBD, so look for products with a THC/CBD ratio of at least 5:1 (1:1 THC:CBD is better in my opinion).
