What I learned in school.

School taught me to be a great little slave monkey.  I learned how to do any task, no matter how meaningless, assigned to me by my master.  I learned how to complete piles and piles of mostly useless busywork, all on paper.  I learned how to sit down, shut up, and listen to any idiot that was assigned to speak to me for hours on end.  I learned how to space out, to defocus, when teachers (and pastors) were giving their lectures, because they usually weren't helpful and I had to go learn as I did the homework anyway.  I learned how to be a good little slave monkey that did as he was told, without questioning.

I did not learn how to make anything useful.  I did not learn how to create value.  I did not learn how to be independent and survive on my own.
