### Summary

After developing chronic sinusitis, which was giving me nasty headaches and mucus problems, I decided to start measuring my air quality in order to remedy my situation.  <a href="air-quality">What I found was an unpalatable surprise</a>--pretty much anywhere with decent concentration of cars and trucks has bad air quality.  Since I didn't want to spend $200 on an air quality monitor, I started building my own from electronic components.

### Options for sensors

There is essentially one company that makes inexpensive air quality sensors--<a href="http://www.shinyei.co.jp/stc/optical/main_dust_e.html">Shinyei<a>, a Japanese company.  Their cheapest model is the PPD42NJ, which a Korean company--<a href="http://www.samyoungsnc.com/eng/m2/sub31.php">Samyoung</a> copied (called the DSM501).  The Samyoung model can be purchased for a few dollars on aliexpress, the Shinyei model is about 2x the cost, but seems more accurate.  Shinyei also makes much more expensive sensors, with better sensitivity (the PPD60V).

### First prototype

Sometime in the Fall, while searching on the internet for reasons for congested sinuses and mucus buildup, I came across <a href="http://www.howmuchsnow.com/arduino/airquality/grovedust/">air quality measurements</a> and <a href="">their effect on health<a>, and purchased one of the Shinyei PPD42 sensors.  I hooked it up to an Arduino, and started logging data on my local machine (<a href="">Github here</a>), using the code from <a href="http://www.howmuchsnow.com/arduino/airquality/grovedust/">Chris Nafis<a>.  I then started noticing trends, like air quality getting worse as people cooked and rush hour ensued, and noticed I could bring my air quality into a healthy range with an inexpensive <a href="http://www.picobay.com/projects/uploaded_images/IMG_1108-730879.JPG">DIY air purifier</a>.
