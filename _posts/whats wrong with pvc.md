Whats the deal with PVC?

Many hippies (and possibly other non-hippies) will tell you PVC is awful and we should banish it.  But is it that bad?  What are the problems?  Well, for one thing, the old way of manufacturing seemed to cause a lot of liver deaths.  One study shows that back in the 60s and 70s, your chance of getting liver cancer was about 5 times higher than normal if you worked in a PVC plant.  Since 1980, the [same study shows](http://oem.bmj.com/content/59/6/405.long) the chances of getting liver cancer were actually lower working in the PVC factory (probably an artifact of the small amount of deaths: 6 out of 3293 tracked people).  

We analysed the cause specific SMR stratified by calendar year of first exposure. The SMR for liver cancer was 4.82 (11 observed v 2.3 expected, 95% CI: 2.41 to 8.63) for those first employed before 1970, 1.92 (8 observed v 4.2 expected, 95% CI: 0.83 to 3.79) for those employed between 1970 and 1979, and 0.78 (6 observed v 7.7 expected, 95% CI: 0.28 to 1.69) for those employed after 1980. 

So far, I can't find anything conclusive as to how much lead, how much DHPE (a planticizer which *might* cause cancer, obesity, decrease IQ, we have no idea really right now--the studies out there on it aren't conclusive yet) are in PVC.  Vinyl flooring has been showing by one study to cause allergies in kids.
