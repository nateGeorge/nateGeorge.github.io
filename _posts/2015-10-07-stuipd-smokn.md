## Smoking makes you dumb...or does it?

So it turns out smoking cannabis makes you stupid!  Or so some studies say (more need to be done of course.)  In [this study](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/40/E2657){:target="_blank"} [(referenced here)](http://www.nature.com/news/drop-in-iq-linked-to-heavy-teenage-cannabis-use-1.11278){:target="_blank"} published in the well-respected scientific journal, PNAS, the authors tracked IQ and 
amount of ganja smoked for 1000 people.  Major conclusions: smoking herb for 20+ years and starting before you are 18 will decrease your IQ by a full 10 points.
The decrease is less severe if you don't start smoking until after 18, but the paper found any amount of smoking will cause a decrease in your IQ (basically a linear relationship between IQ and lifetime cannabis use).  A few caveats to the study: everyone was from New Zealand.  Though the overall number of people studied is large, the number of marijuana users decreases with increasing use, throwing a wrench in the statistical certainty of the argument.  There was an [argument published](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/11/4251.abstract){:target="_blank"} that said the socioeconomic statuses made the results flawed, but the authors of the original paper of course [said it's not true](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3600438/){:target="_blank"}.  I haven't looked into it enough to know for sure what the truth really is.

I wondered though, how much of this is due to the actual THC/cannabis chemical concoction entering the bloodstream, and how much is due to inhaling enormous amounts of unfiltered 
smoke? In my recent health quests, I've become more aware of air quality, and noticed how it's hard to be able to instinctively tell if air quality is poor (you don't usually notice the air quality is bad unless there's visible smoke).  So, being that herb smokers proudly inhale huge quantities of thick smoke, I would think that the fact they're inhaling copious amounts of pollution could effect the quality of their brain and intelligence.

So I checked if just smoking causes lower intelligence--and yes, it does, [by about 7.5 points, according to this study.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/23/us-smokers-smarter-idUSTRE61M3UQ20100223){:target="_blank"}  But that's also being debated, as nicotine is a brain-enhancing drug (general stimulant, so it increases glucose utilization in the brain), and there are some anecdotes of cognitive improvement after smoking a cigarette.
The other 2.5 point decrease difference between ganja smokers and tobacco smokers could be due to the chemicals in weed (THC, principally)--or, it could be because weed smokers smoke unfiltered plant material.  THC of course also typically hinders your brain (especially memory), so it would make sense that constant THC use would decrease IQ.  The only way to settle this question would be to do a test with edible-only users vs smokers vs non-smokers.

Counter-point: this [canadian study](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/7/887.full.pdf+html){:target="_blank"} ([referenced here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150103052503/http://www.spiritscienceandmetaphysics.com/study-finds-marijuana-increases-your-iq){:target="_blank"}) says only heavy users will be dumber.  Light and former users are smarter so they say.  However, this study only assessed people at ages 17-20.

Another [study](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/twins-study-finds-no-evidence-marijuana-lowers-iq-teens) found no evidence for decreasing IQ with cannabis use.

## Conclusion, or lack thereof

The verdict?  Still undecided.  However, it seems (and makes logical sense) that being high on THC all the time is not good for your intelligence.  Is infrequent use bad, especially if you consume cannabis *via* edibles or drinkables?  The jury is still out on that one, as there are currently no studies that have been done on the IQ effects of cannabis-infused products that I'm aware of.
