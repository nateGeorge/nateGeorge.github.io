Something particularly interesting I noticed is that while the rates of smoking have [gone down significantly](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2012/02/cigarette-smoking-another-factor-in.html):

the rates of lung and bronchial cancer [have gone up massively, especially for men:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21166/pdf):

I can't help but think some of that is from pollution, but the smoking and cancer death curves for men look shockinly similar, just offset by 30 years.  Don't smoke; it's bad for you.  Yes, even smoking weed is bad for you, despite what a few obscure studies may show--smoke is pollution!  [Smoking weed regularly](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/40/E2657.abstract) and [smoking cigarettes](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-smokers-smarter-idUSTRE61M3UQ20100223) has been shown to make you dumber.  For weed, we know that it effects short-term memory and concentration negatively, so it is obvious that being high all the time is going to make you stupid.  Using cannabis once or twice a week is probably fine, although the study did show a slight decrease in IQ from *smoking* cannabis more often.  Nothing was studied with consuming cannabis in other ways, such as eating, drinking, or other ways of consumption besides smoking.  

Confusingly, smoking cigarettes has also been shown to increase intelligence(https://www.sott.net/article/269265-Brain-Researchers-Smoking-increases-intelligence).  
To me, it seems genetics may play a role here.  Since smoke contains oxidants, to which the brain is very sensitive, it seems the capability of a persons body to fight these oxidants will determine how much the smoke damages their brain.  The less able someone is to fight off the oxidation of the smoke, the more likely they will become dumber from smoking.  This is just a hypothesis at this point.

Nicotine increases glucose utilization by the brain (and in doing so, seems like a nootropic), and has [some positive effects for your brain](http://nootriment.com/nicotine/).  My guess is the nicotine in cigarettes is the main reason for cigarettes increasing intelligence.

The report referenced on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine) that says nicotine is addictive cites some [huge compilation of studies (surgeon general's report from the 80s)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi9-I6VttbMAhUkzIMKHeo6B2kQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprofiles.nlm.nih.gov%2Fps%2Faccess%2FNNBBZD.pdf&usg=AFQjCNGoapv5TEQfeSNzUq8Lpn6dk-6ZKw&sig2=gVxJU84geYkQDIw3OAc4XQ), that says nothing about the addictiveness of nicotine--only the addictiveness of cigarettes.  To me this seems dishonest and lazy--if there is a study showing nicotine is addictive and neurotoxic, cite the actual scientific study, not some huge report that may contain some study with some evidence.

The utilization of glucose in rat brains was shown to increase after administration of nicotine, by about 2x in many parts of the brain.  This is from a [government report on how cigarettes are bad for you.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi9-I6VttbMAhUkzIMKHeo6B2kQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprofiles.nlm.nih.gov%2Fps%2Faccess%2FNNBBZD.pdf&usg=AFQjCNGoapv5TEQfeSNzUq8Lpn6dk-6ZKw&sig2=gVxJU84geYkQDIw3OAc4XQ).  This seems to mean nicotine gives your brain a boost; or in other words, nicotine is a nootropic.

It's also unclear whether nicotine is carcinogenic and if it is actually addictive.  Of course, cigarettes are addictive, but they have lots of other chemicals in them.  Whether the chemical we love and know as *nicotine* is actually addictive remains to be proven at this moment.  The ["evidence" provided on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Reinforcement_disorders) is just a statement in a government report([the paper](http://cdph.ca.gov/programs/tobacco/Documents/Media/State%20Health-e-cig%20report.pdf), [and the paper they site for "nicotene" (actually cigarette) addictiveness](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi9-I6VttbMAhUkzIMKHeo6B2kQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprofiles.nlm.nih.gov%2Fps%2Faccess%2FNNBBZD.pdf&usg=AFQjCNGoapv5TEQfeSNzUq8Lpn6dk-6ZKw&sig2=gVxJU84geYkQDIw3OAc4XQ)) with no evidence to back it up, as far as I can tell.  There are some studies that talk about nicotine and addiction referenced on wikipedia as well, and if someone can explain how they demonstrate nicotene's addictiveness, please let me know.
