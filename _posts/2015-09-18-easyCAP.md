### Camera troubles

I'm setting up a calibration platform for particle sensors, and I need a camera to capture the data from the Dylos sensor, because it only outputs data over serial once per minute, and I need once per second.  So I need to capture an image of the number output on the display, process it and extract the data.  Unfortunately, I don't have any webcams lying around the house, and I'm not about to go spend $20 for one when I have another camera here.  It's a <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Micro-600TVL-5MP-1-4-HD-New-Smallest-Mini-Camera-CCTV-Camera-Home-Security-Surveillance-cam/32309414586.html">small camera</a>, probably the same as in your laptop and webcams.  (I was going to use it as a remote security webcam, but then I found out it's much harder to interface a camera with a microcontroller than I thought.)  So I hooked it up to an <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/USB-2-0-Video-Easycap-TV-DVD-VHS-Capture-Card-Audio-AV-Easiercap-Adapter-for-Computer/32285684744.html">easyCAP</a> I have with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rca+patch+cable&oq=rca+patch+cable&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1789j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8#q=rca+patch+cable+yellow&safe=off&tbm=shop&spd=15969221372992882225">patch cable</a>, and tried to interface it with Python on a Windows laptop, which became very difficult.  Eventually, I was able to get it working with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22146205/grab-frame-ntsctousb-dongle-opencv2-python-wrapper/22183737#22183737">this tip</a>.  The steps I had to take to get it working were:

<ul>
<li><a href="cam diagram1.jpg">get a power supply</a> for the camera, I found from my <a href="handy.jpg">handy-dandy power supply</a> that 'positive' polarity is required, and 4.5V is the minimum (on my PSU) that would power the camera.  A 9.6V PSU was making the camera get very toasty, not good for long term use.  <a href="cam diagram2.jpg">The manual says use 5-12V</a></li>
<li>in device manager, right click your laptop webcam under 'Imaging Devices', and choose disable</li>
<li>install <a href="http://www.trackercam.com/TCamWeb/dvdriver.htm">DVDriver</a></li>
<li>install <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0">cv2 for python</a> (I had to use version <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.10/">2.4.10 for windows</a> to get KNearest working)</li>
<li>run the <a href="http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html#capture-video-from-camera">cv2 demo</a></li>
<li>profit</li>
</ul>

The cd that came with easyCAP is <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nbzpv53f6jebaof/easyCAP-software--TVR25-NMBGG-HGGGH-362DC-6BMG6.iso?dl=0">here</a> if anyone needs it.

With linux, this is easier because you can <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=76737">call mplayer with subprocess</a>.
