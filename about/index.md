I grew up in Elkhorn, Nebraska, get a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines, then got a PhD in Chemical Engineering from UCSB (studying phosphors used in solid-state lighting), then I worked for a CIGS solar cell factory for a year in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I just left that job, and am entrepreneuring internet of things products for home and farm automation.
